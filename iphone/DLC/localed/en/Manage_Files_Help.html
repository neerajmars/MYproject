		<h1>Manage Files Help</h1>
		<div style="text-align:justify;">
		<p>Use this page to access the Application Files outlined in the iDim Orbit Application Brochure.  Custom Application Files are stored here and can exported as back-ups, or shared with other users.</p>

            <h3>Application Files</h3>
            <div>
				<p>
				Contains five pre-configured application files including the Default settings, Cellular Office, Open Plan Office and Classrooms 1 and 2.  For more information about how to use these Application Files, please refer to the iDim Orbit Application Brochure https://www.helvar.com/media/pd/2016/20161109/iDimOrbit-BROCHURE_EN.pdf.  To use a file, touch on folder and select the required file.  Select Import then Sync to load the settings into iDim Orbit.  The Default application file restores the original factory settings but is not a full reset so does not restore the unlock passcode or device name.</p>
            </div>
			
			
			 <h3>Custom Application Files</h3>
			 <div>
			<p>Once custom files have been created, retrieve them at any time by opening the Custom Files folder, select the file, import it and press Sync.  To back a file up or share it with other users, select a file and press Share.  It is then possible to attach the file to an email, or store it to app services loaded on the device with storage capabilities such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive.  The importing process varies depending on service provider.  From iCloud Drive, select the file,  press the export button (bottom left) and then select 'Copy to iDim Orbit'.  The file will now appear in the Custom Application Files section.</p>
